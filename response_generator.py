Welcome to Recipe Bot!
----------------------
I can help you find recipes based on ingredients you have.

Tell me what ingredients you have, and I'll suggest recipes you can make.
For example, you can ask: "What can I make with eggs, flour, and sugar?"

Type "help" for more information or "quit" to exit.

Recipe Bot Help:
---------------
Here's how to use Recipe Bot:

1. Find recipes by ingredients:
   Example: "What can I make with chicken, rice, and tomatoes?"

2. Exclude ingredients:
   Example: "Find recipes with potatoes but without cheese"

3. Ask for specific dietary preferences:
   Example: "Vegetarian recipes with mushrooms"
   Example: "Quick dinner ideas with chicken"
   Example: "Gluten-free desserts"

4. View recipe details:
   After seeing recipe matches, enter the number or name of a recipe.

5. Exit the chatbot:
   Type "quit" or "exit"
